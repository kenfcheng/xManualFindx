# xManualFindx
Manual Find is a personal project I am working on that takes what I learned in React and incorporating it with other technologies that I'm learning on my own.

# Concept
The idea of community-based file sharing is nothing new.  From the pioneering days of music files to the sharing of 3D printing files today, file sharing has always relied on a community of people working together for a common interests.   What Manual Find aims to do is build that same community, for those who would be interested in preserving old instructional documents that are no longer printed or accessible online.  Even with the advancement of techology, we still have a large population of people who use older and perceptively "outdated" technologies that companies have long sinced stopped supporting.

Manual Find's goal is to create a space where people can upload/download old manuals that they can't find anywhere else in order to help troubleshoot, repair, or restore older technologies that are no longer supported. 

# Technologies
  - React
  - Firebase
  - Boostrap

# Features
The entire application is being developed using React.  I'm exploring various packages to use in React such as DropZone to add "drag n' drop" file features to the application. I've also set up Firebase to handle user authentication and database for the files.
